//SMART Component - Logical Representation
//Dumb Component - Presentation

Information Exchange from Parent to Child is using props
Child reads the data using this.Props (default keyword from React JS)

APP
    Currency
    ProductList
        Product: required

Class based component : stateful component ---> SMART
Functional: stateless component ---> DUMB

Controlled and Uncontrolled components
static type checking of props
Routing

    components
    containers
    core (for core services) Eg: Service Calls
    shared: shared resources (common component)

OR

Screen Design
_____________________

APP
    Header > Menu > Currency
    MAIN > Router > ProductList
    Footer

Src
   ui 
     component
        Header.jsx
        Footer.jsx
        Menu.jsx

Router Provides 3 Object for Navigation
________________________________________________

1.history Object is used for Navigation
2.match Object for passing Params: Two techniques
    1. Rest Parameters: abc.com/product/123    
3.location used for Query Parameters
    2. Query Parameters: abc.com/product?pid=123


Redux: Is a library which impliments flux 

npm install redux -S
npm install react-redux -S

1. Defining all the actions
    actions are functions which return a dispatcher objects
2. Defining reducer for all the actions declared in step 1
    reducer is a finctions which evaluates the types of dispatcher object & returns
    this updated state to the store
3. Creating a store using a reducers from step 2
4. Providing the store to the App
5. Connecting the components to the store to update/retrieve the data from store

src
   _store    
        actions
            currencyActions.js
            cartActions.js
        reducers
        index.js

Hooks from React version 16.8  --> State mgmt for child or functional components
Routing: Authorization
    containers  
        Login.jsx
HOC: Higher order components
Middlewares in redux: Support Async Action and Provide and dispatch object inside the actions
